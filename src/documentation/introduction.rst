Introduction
************

The project is built using the Project templates provided by von Gaudecker (2014,  :cite:`GaudeckerEconProjectTemplates`). A general introduction to the project-build system waf and the design of the templates can be found at 
`here <http://hmgaudecker.github.io/econ-project-templates/>`_.

The project consists of a simulation study and the estimation of the world income distribution.

To run the entire project with waf, proceed as outlined in the README.md file contained in the main directory.

*Note*: The project was originally built running Python 3.4.4 and R 3.2.3 on a machine running Mac OS X 10.11.6.
