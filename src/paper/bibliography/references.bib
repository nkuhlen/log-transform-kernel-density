@article{Quah1996a,
	Abstract = {Convergence concerns poor economies catching up with rich ones. At issue is what happens to the cross sectional distribution of economies, not whether a single economy tends toward its own steady state. It is the latter, however, that has preoccupied the traditional approach to convergence analysis. This paper describes a body of research that overcomes this shortcoming in the traditional approach. The new findings - on persistence and stratification; on the formation of convergence clubs; and on the distribution polarising into twin peaks of which and poor - suggest the relevance of a class of theoretical ideas, different from the production-function accounting traditionally favored.},

Some "second generation" methods, including plug-in and smoothed bootstrap techniques, have been developed that are far superior to well-known "first generation" methods, such as rules of thumb, least squares cross-validation, and biased cross-validation. We recommend a "solve-the-equation" plug-in bandwidth selector as being most reliable in terms of overall performance. This article is intended to provide easy accessibility to the main ideas for nonexperts.},

Hall (1983) has established the consistency and asymptotic optimality of the new method. For small and moderate sized samples, the performances of the two methods of cross-validation are compared on simulated data and specific examples.},
